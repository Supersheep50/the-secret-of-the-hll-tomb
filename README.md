Welcome Supersheep50,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!

### Local Deployment
​

​
### Heroku Deployment
​
This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
​
Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:
​
- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select *Create new app* from the dropdown menu.
- Enter a name for your app. The app name must be unique, so you need to adjust the name until you find a name that hasn't been used.
- From the dropdown, choose the region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select *Create App*.
- From the new app *Settings*, click *Reveal Config Vars*, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- Now, add a seecond Config Var for the `creds.json`file, which contains the API Key from Google Sheets. Set the value of KEY to `CREDS` and paste the entire contents of `creds.json` in the VALUE box. Select *add*.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select *Add buildpack*.
- The order of the buildpacks is important. Select `Python` first, then *Save changes*. Click *Add buildpack* again, and select `Node.js`, then *Save changes*. If they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs to be updated using: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The Procfile can be created with the following command: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:
​
- At the top of the screen on Heroku, select *Deploy*.
- Next to *Deployment method* select *GitHub*, then scroll down and click *Connect to GitHub* to confirm you want to connect.
- In the *repo-name* field, search for the name of the GitHub repository to deploy, and click *Search*.
- Click *Connect* to link the GitHub repository with Heroku. 
- Scroll down to the *Manual deploy* section, and click *Deploy Branch*.
- If you like, click *Enable Automatic Deploys* in the *Automatic deploys* section to have Heroku rebuild your app every time you push a new change to GitHub.

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.
